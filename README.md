The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly become a global health emergency.

> Scientists are working around the clock to understand the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 and how infected human cells respond to it.

In this context, the current project analysed the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection using RNA-sequencing data from a cell model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 lung biopsy from *post mortem* COVID-19 patient. The data, obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147507), came from the paper: *Daniel Blanco-Melo, Benjamin E. Nilsson-Payant, Wen-Chun Liu, Rasmus MÃ¸ller, Maryline Panis, David Sachs, Randy A. Albrecht, Benjamin R. tenOever. **SARS-CoV-2 launches a unique transcriptional signature from in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo systems**. bioRxiv 2020.03.24.004655*.
